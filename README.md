# DMS_Python
A repository for Jupyter Notebook files including examples and exercises for DMS Python book.



**Download**

DMS Python book readers are encouraged to download the accompanying Jupyter Notebook files, which include examples and exercises, from here. 
The files in the learner directory are designed for practice, allowing readers to run examples from the book and engage in scripting exercises with omitted lines. The educator directory contains fully written solutions and examples for reference, enabling users to verify their work.
While you can download files individually, it is recommended to download the entire repository as a zip file and extract it.

**Open Jupyter Notebook files**

Once users have downloaded and unzipped the repository, go to the learner or educator directory and double-click the run.bat file to execute it. This will launch Jupyter Notebook based on the selected directory. For MacOS users, run the run.sh file instead.
